- Extracting the App Name from PID:
  - (34, App Name, DuckDuckGo, 10)
- Extracting the Human Name from ownerName:
  - (34, Human Name, Doggybites bvba, 5)  [Note: Confidence is lower because "Doggybites bvba" might not be a standard human name but rather a company name; however, it's treated as a human name due to lack of clear distinction in the input.]

**Explanation:**
1. **App Name**: The PID "com.duckduckgo.mobile.android" clearly identifies the app as "DuckDuckGo". The confidence level is high (10) because the PID directly corresponds to a well-known app.
2. **Human Name**: "Doggybites bvba" is extracted from the ownerName attribute. The confidence level is set to 5 because it appears to be a company name rather than a personal name, but it is included as a human name due to the lack of explicit differentiation in the input data.

No other evidence entities such as usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, search keywords, messages, geographic coordinates, or timestamps are identifiable from the provided data. The rules attribute contains JavaScript file paths, which do not provide extractable evidence entities as defined.

**Final Output Format:**

   - Extracted from `ownerName` attribute with value "dimelo sas". Although typically a company name, it could be interpreted as a human name in some contexts.
   - Confidence score: 8 (Moderate confidence due to ambiguity in whether it's strictly a human name or a company name).

3. **Search Keywords:**
   - Extracted from the `rules` attribute. Keywords "messaging" and "chat" are derived from the URLs provided in the rules.
   - Confidence score: 7 (Moderate confidence due to clear presence in the URL but lower because they are common terms that might not always represent intentional search keywords).

**Note:**
- No phone numbers, email addresses, messages, geographic addresses, or timestamps were identified in the provided row.
- Confidence levels are assigned based on the clarity and directness of the information extracted relative to the known entity types.

**Explanation:**

1. **App Name**: The PID 'com.duckduckgo.mobile.android' is converted to the human-readable app name "DuckDuckGo". Confidence is high (10) because the PID directly corresponds to a well-known app.

2. **Human Name**: The ownerName 'JustAnswer LLC' is recognized as a human name, though it represents a company name. The confidence is slightly lower (8) because it's a corporate entity, not an individual's name.

3. **Search Keywords**: Extracted from the rules attribute, which contains multiple URL paths that include keywords related to the functionality of the website (e.g., "ja-gadget-virtual-assistant-config"). Each keyword is extracted separately with a confidence level of 7 due to the clear context provided by the rules structure but considering they are part of URLs and not standalone keywords.

No phone numbers, email addresses, messages, geographic addresses, or timestamps were identified in the provided row, hence they are not included in the output.

Based on the input row provided and the definitions and strategies outlined, let's analyze and extract the evidence entities:

**Input row (r):**
{
(LID, 12643), (PID, com.duckduckgo.mobile.android), (DN, app.db), (DP, data/user/0/com.duckduckgo.mobile.android/databases/app.db), (TN, tds_tracker), (RL, 540), (domain, mybestpro.com), (defaultAction, IGNORE), (ownerName, WENGO SAS), (categories, []), (rules, [{"rule":"mybestpro\\.com\\/general\\.js"}])
}

**Analysis:**
1. **PID (App Identifier)**: "com.duckduckgo.mobile.android" can be converted to the human-readable app name "DuckDuckGo".
2. **ownerName**: "WENGO SAS" appears to be a company name, not a human name.
3. **domain**: "mybestpro.com" does not directly provide any specific evidence entity but could be considered under search keywords due to its relevance in web activity.
4. **rules**: The rule value contains a URL pattern which might include search keywords, but in this case, it's more of a script path than a keyword.

**Extracted Entities:**
1. App Name: "DuckDuckGo" with high confidence as it directly maps from the PID.
2. Search Keyword: "mybestpro.com" considering it as a keyword used in web domain searches.

**Confidence Levels:**
- App Name: High confidence (10) as the mapping from PID to app name is straightforward and reliable.
- Search Keyword: Moderate confidence (6) since "mybestpro.com" is a domain name and might be used as a keyword in searches but isn't a traditional search keyword.

**Output:**
(LID, 540); (540, App Name, DuckDuckGo, 10); (540, Search Keyword, mybestpro.com, 6);

This output format adheres to the specified output format, listing each evidence entity with its type, value, and confidence score, all linked to the specific row line number (RL).

}

**Output:**
- Extracting the App Name from PID:
  - PID: com.duckduckgo.mobile.android → App Name: DuckDuckGo
  - Confidence Level: High confidence as the PID directly maps to a well-known app name.
  
- Extracting the Human Name from ownerName:
  - ownerName: ONEALL SARL → Human Name: Not applicable (It's a company name, not a human name)
  - Confidence Level: Low confidence as SARL indicates a company rather than an individual.

- Extracting the Domain as a potential Search Keyword:
  - domain: oneall.com → Search Keyword: oneall.com
  - Confidence Level: Medium confidence as domains can often be used as search keywords but without additional context, it's not certain.

**Formatted Output:**
(LID, 570); (570, App Name, DuckDuckGo, 10); (570, Search Keyword, oneall.com, 5);

**Explanation:**
- **App Name** ("DuckDuckGo") is extracted with high confidence (10) because the PID directly corresponds to a known app.
- **Search Keyword** ("oneall.com") is extracted with medium confidence (5) because it is a domain name which could be used as a search keyword, but without more context, it's not definitive as a search term.
- **Human Name** is not extracted because "ONEALL SARL" is identified as a company name, not a human name, and thus does not fit the criteria for extraction.

Based on the input row provided and the definitions and strategies outlined, let's analyze and extract the evidence entities:

**Input row (r):**
{
(LID, 13350), (PID, com.twitter.android), (DN, 1378525099184291843-61.db), (DP, data/data/com.twitter.android/databases/1378525099184291843-61.db), (TN, tokens), (RL, 598), (_id, 656), (text, lina), (type, 1), (ref_id, 36683532), (weight, 52278)
}

**Analysis:**
1. **PID (com.twitter.android)** - This indicates the application identifier, which can be converted to a human-readable app name.
2. **text (lina)** - This could potentially be a username or a human name. Given the lack of additional context, it's difficult to definitively categorize it as a human name.

**Extracted Evidence Entities:**
1. **App Name** - From PID, "com.twitter.android" can be confidently identified as "Twitter".
2. **Username or Human Name** - "lina" from the text attribute. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine if "lina" is a username or a human name. However, given the commonality of such a name, it can be tentatively identified as a human name.

**Output:**
- (598, App Name, Twitter, 10); - High confidence as the app name directly corresponds to the well-known Twitter app.
- (598, Human Name, Lina, 5); - Moderate confidence due to ambiguity in determining if "lina" is a username or a human name without additional context.

**Final Output:**
```
(LID, 13350); (598, App Name, Twitter, 10); (598, Human Name, Lina, 5);
